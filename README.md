PromptTTS is a controllable text-to-speech (TTS) system that takes a prompt with both style and content descriptions as input to synthesize corresponding speech. Unlike traditional TTS systems, which generate speech solely from raw text, PromptTTS leverages text descriptions to guide the synthesis process. It consists of a style encoder, a content encoder, and a speech decoder. The style encoder extracts style representations, the content encoder extracts content representations, and the speech decoder synthesizes speech based on these extracted features.
